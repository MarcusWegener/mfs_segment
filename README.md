# mfs_segment
Segment display helper for Arduino Multi-Function Shield

I've created a LibreOffice Calc file called "mfs_segment_map.ods" to get the hex code for a 7-segment character.
Various examples are included.

An example sketch "mfs_scrolling_text" for the Arduino Multi-Function Shield is also included.
